# Covid-19-prediction
Repository that holds my final project that i completed during the computing part of my Joint degree course where i created a tool that predicts COVID-19 infection rates using different datasets

# Project Description:
This project is a data-driven application developed as part of the final project during the computing segment of a joint degree course. This tool is designed to predict COVID-19 infection rates by leveraging multiple datasets and using the prophet library. The primary objective of this project was to provide a reliable forecasting model that can assist health professionals, policymakers, and the general public in understanding the potential future trajectory of the pandemic

# Technologies Used:
* Python: The primary programming language used for data analysis and prediction modelling
* Pandas: A powerful data analysis and manipulation library for Python.
* prophet: A powerful forecasting tool used for making forecasts for time series data that i used to forecast future covid-19 infection rates.

# Problems Faced:
* Data cleaning: Handling missing or inconsistent data in the datasets as dealing with worldwide datasets there was a lot of missing and null values. To enhance the project, I plan to integrate data from various sources and refine the prediction models using more sophisticated algorithms. Additionally, I aspire to incorporate geographical information to visualize the virus's spread on a global map.
* Model Accuracy: Fine tuning the prediction model to improve accuracy.
* finding recent datasets
